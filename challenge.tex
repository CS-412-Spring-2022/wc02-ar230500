\begin{questions}
  
\question We are given the following relations among the functions, $f, g, h$, and $i$.
  \begin{align*}
    f(n) = O(g(n))\\
    f(n) = \Omega(h(n))\\
    f(n) = \Theta(i(n))
  \end{align*}



involved.
  ,  \noindent\textbf{TASK}: Visualize these relations in a single plot by making appropriate choices for $f, g, h$, and $i$. Make sure that the plot clearly indicates the constants 
  \noindent\textbf{TASK}: Include the plot below.
  
  \noindent\textbf{TASK}: Indicate below the functions that you have chosen for $f, g, h$, and $i$ and explain below how the indicated constants fulfill the corresponding definitions. Feel free to refer to the visualization in your explanation.
  
  \noindent\textbf{TASK}:  Also share your visualization as a comment on the \textit{Week 02 Challenge} post in the course group on Yammer.
